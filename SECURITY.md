# Security Guidelines for UTI DOS GAMES

## Overview
This document outlines security best practices and procedures for administrators and developers working with the UTI DOS GAMES platform.

## Admin Account Security

### Initial Setup
1. **Never use default credentials** - All admin accounts must use strong, unique passwords
2. **Change default passwords immediately** after first login
3. **Use secure email addresses** for admin accounts (preferably with 2FA enabled on the email provider)

### Password Requirements
- Minimum 12 characters
- Include uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters
- Use unique passwords not used elsewhere
- Change passwords every 90 days

### Account Management
- Limit admin accounts to essential personnel only
- Review admin access quarterly
- Remove unused admin accounts immediately
- Monitor all admin login activities

## Authentication Security

### Login Security Features
- **Rate limiting**: Maximum 5 failed attempts before 5-minute lockout
- **Security logging**: All login attempts are logged with timestamps and user agents
- **Enhanced error messages**: Generic error messages to prevent user enumeration
- **Session monitoring**: Admin sessions are specially monitored and logged

### Security Monitoring
All security events are logged including:
- Failed login attempts
- Successful admin logins
- Admin session restorations
- User signups and errors

### Best Practices for Users
1. **Use strong passwords** (minimum 6 characters, preferably longer)
2. **Don't share accounts** - Each person should have their own account
3. **Log out when finished** - Especially on shared computers
4. **Report suspicious activity** immediately

## Database Security

### Row Level Security (RLS)
- All tables have RLS enabled where appropriate
- Users can only access their own data
- Admin functions are properly secured with security definer functions

### Data Protection
- User passwords are hashed by Supabase Auth
- Sensitive operations require authentication
- Admin actions are logged for audit trails

## Production Deployment Security

### Before Going Live
1. **Remove all test accounts** including any demo admin accounts
2. **Set up proper admin accounts** with secure credentials
3. **Enable email confirmation** for user signups
4. **Configure proper redirect URLs** in Supabase settings
5. **Set up monitoring** for security events
6. **Review all RLS policies** to ensure they're correctly configured

### Ongoing Security
1. **Regular security audits** of admin accounts and permissions
2. **Monitor security logs** for suspicious activity
3. **Keep dependencies updated** regularly
4. **Backup database** regularly with secure storage
5. **Review user accounts** periodically for inactive or suspicious accounts

## Incident Response

### If Security Breach Suspected
1. **Immediately change all admin passwords**
2. **Review security logs** for unauthorized access
3. **Check database** for unauthorized changes
4. **Notify all administrators**
5. **Consider temporary lockdown** if needed
6. **Document the incident** and response actions

### Emergency Contacts
- Primary Admin: [Contact Information]
- Technical Lead: [Contact Information]
- Supabase Support: support@supabase.io

## Development Security

### Code Security
1. **Never commit secrets** to version control
2. **Use environment variables** for sensitive configuration
3. **Validate all user inputs** on frontend and backend
4. **Use parameterized queries** to prevent SQL injection
5. **Implement proper error handling** without exposing system details

### Testing Security
1. **Use separate test databases** from production
2. **Don't use production data** in development
3. **Test security features** regularly
4. **Perform security reviews** before major releases

## Compliance and Auditing

### Regular Reviews
- Monthly review of admin accounts and permissions
- Quarterly security audit of the entire system
- Annual penetration testing (recommended)
- Continuous monitoring of security logs

### Documentation
- Keep this document updated with any security changes
- Document all security incidents and responses
- Maintain audit logs for compliance purposes
